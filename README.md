# C_Libray
WeThinkCode project to create a full functioning C-Library from scratch using a norm standard of 5 
functions max per file in which each function is allowed a max of 25 line and 80 coloumns. 
Each function has to be coded to be used dynamically with any future projects. 
The project asked for 40 functions orginally but over time I added more of my own as projects got
bigger and required more complex functions.
